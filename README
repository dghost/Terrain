Procedurally generated terrain

Description: Tesselated meshes deformed and manipulated using procedurally generated textures.

Framework used: OpenGL 4.0, Qt 4.8.4, but it should be compatible with Qt 4.7 (and probably 4.6).

Additional dependencies: GLM (included)

Compilation/execution (under Ubuntu):
1) qmake
2) make
3) ./Terrain

It will compile and run under Ubuntu and Windows (so long as Qt 4.8 is used). OS X is not supported at this time due to it's lack of support for OpenGL 4.0.

Adjustable parameters:
The '1' key toggles between water shaders.
The '2' key toggles between ground shaders.
The '[' and ']' keys adjust the ground patch size.
The 'O' and 'P' keys adjust the ground texture size.
The ';' and ''' keys adjust the water patch size.
The 'K' and 'L' keys adjust the water texture size.
The ',' and '.' keys adjust the cloud texture size.
